A complete DES focal plane from Y1 observations is available at 

http://www.cosmo.bnl.gov/Private/gpfs/workarea/mjarvis/y1_test.tar.gz

We include in the repo a single CCD from this image that we use for testing.

The image is

    DECam_00241238_01.fits.fz 

The catalog with the stars after a series of cuts is
    
    DECam_00241238_01_psfcat_tb_maxmag_17.0_magcut_3.0_findstars.fits

In the DES Y1 analaysis, this was the input file for PSFEx, and the output PSFEx file
is given here as

    DECam_00241238_01_psfcat.psf

And its estimation of which input stars are not outliers is

    DECam_00241238_01_psfcat.used.fits
