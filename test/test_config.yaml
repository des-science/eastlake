    steps: [galsim]

# The gal field defines what kind of galaxy profile to use.
gal :
    # One of the simplest profiles is a Gaussian.
    type : Gaussian

    # Gaussian profiles have a number of possible size parameters, but
    # sigma is the most basic one.
    # The others are fwhm and half_light_radius.  At least one of these must be specified.
    sigma : 2  # arcsec

    # The default flux would be 1, but you would typically want to define the flux
    # to be something other than that.
    flux : 1.e5


# Technically, the psf field isn't required, but for astronomical images we always have a PSF
# so you'll usually want to define one.  (If it's omitted, the galaxy isn't convolved
# by anything, so effectively a delta function PSF.)
# We use a Gaussian again for simplicity, but one somewhat smaller than the galaxy.
psf :
    type : Gaussian
    sigma : 1  # arcsec
    # No need to specify a flux, since flux=1 is the right thing for a PSF.


# The image field specifies some other information about the image to be drawn.
image :
    # If pixel_scale isn't specified, then pixel_scale = 1 is assumed.
    pixel_scale : 0.2  # arcsec / pixel

    # If you want noise in the image (which is typical) you specify that here.
    # In this case we use gaussian noise.
    #noise :
    #    type : Gaussian
    #    sigma : 30  # standard deviation of the counts in each pixel

    # You can also specify the size of the image if you want, but if you omit it
    # (as we do here), then GalSim will automatically size the image appropriately.


# Typically, you will want to specify the output format and file name.
# If this is omitted, the output will be to a fits file with the same root name as the
# config file (so demo1.fits in this case), but that's usually not a great choice.
# So at the very least, you would typically want to specify at least the file_name.
output :
    type : Fits
    dir : output_yaml
    file_name : demo1.fits
